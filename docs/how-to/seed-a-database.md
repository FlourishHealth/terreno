# Seed a database

Use `runSeedCli` to keep development and test data aligned with code. Seed plans
sync by default, can preview writes, and can reset only the data each step owns.

## Define a seed plan

```typescript
import {runSeedCli, type SeedStep} from "@terreno/api";
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import {Todo} from "../models/todo";
import {connectToMongoDB} from "../utils/database";

const steps: SeedStep[] = [
  {
    name: "todos",
    reset: async (context) => {
      await context.deleteMany(Todo);
    },
    run: async (context) => {
      await context.upsert(
        Todo,
        {seedKey: "welcome"},
        {seedKey: "welcome", title: "Welcome to the app"}
      );
    },
  },
];

const result = await runSeedCli({
  allowProductionReset: () => process.env.ALLOW_SEED_RESET === "true",
  connect: connectToMongoDB,
  disconnect: async () => mongoose.disconnect(),
  name: "bun run seed",
  steps,
});

process.exit(result.exitCode);
```

Add the package command:

```json
{"scripts": {"seed": "bun run src/scripts/seed.ts"}}
```

## Run seeds

```bash
bun run seed                         # create or update code-defined data
bun run seed --dry-run               # preview without writes
bun run seed --only todos            # one step and its dependencies
bun run seed --reset                 # reset managed data, then reseed
```

`--only` may be repeated. Declare `dependsOn` when one step needs records from
another; dependencies run first. In reset mode, reset handlers run in reverse
order so dependent records are removed before their parents.

## Make sync runs idempotent

Use `context.upsert(model, key, values)` with a stable, unique business key.
The helper reports `created`, `updated`, or `unchanged` and writes only when the
declared values differ. Nested arrays are compared without generated subdocument
`_id`s, so feature-flag rules and similar payloads stay unchanged across syncs.
If `isDeletedPlugin` hid a matching row, `upsert` restores that document instead
of inserting a duplicate. Use `context.deleteMany()` only inside reset handlers.
Custom writes must check `context.dryRun` themselves.

For Better Auth credentials, call `seedBetterAuthUser({auth, user, userModel})`.
It creates a missing credential account, signs in when the account already
exists, and reconciles the application user document.

## Guard destructive resets

Production reset mode is denied by default. It runs only when both conditions
are true:

1. The CLI receives `--force`.
2. `allowProductionReset` returns `true` (normally from a dedicated environment variable).

Reset handlers should delete only records owned by the seed plan. Preserve
authentication, migration history, and operator-created data unless the plan
explicitly manages them.
