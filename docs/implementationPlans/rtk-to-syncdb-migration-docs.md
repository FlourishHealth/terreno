# Implementation Plan: RTK Deprecation and SyncDB Migration Docs

**Status:** Draft — blocked on PR #869
**Priority:** Critical (gates most of Wave 1)
**Effort:** Big batch
**Owner:** unassigned
**Created:** 2026-07-27
**Program:** [OSS launch](oss-launch-program.md)
**Depends on:** PR [#869](https://github.com/flourishhealth/terreno/pull/869) merging
**RTK deprecation flag:** **Blocked** — this IP *is* the RTK deprecation. Nothing here can be written until #869 lands, because the public surface of `@terreno/syncdb` is not final until then.

## Goal

Make **Better Auth + `@terreno/syncdb`** the documented, blessed frontend platform, and give every existing `@terreno/rtk` consumer a correct, tested migration path. This is the gating IP for the launch documentation: publishing tutorials, reference docs, or a positioning rewrite against RTK Query would guarantee an immediate rewrite.

Scope is documentation, deprecation signalling, and migration tooling — not syncdb feature work (that is PR #869's own scope).

## Non-Goals

- Implementing or changing `@terreno/syncdb` behavior.
- Migrating internal Flourish applications (tracked separately).
- Removing `@terreno/rtk` from the repo or unpublishing it.
- Rewriting the tutorials themselves — that is [`docs-tutorials-ai-first`](docs-tutorials-ai-first.md), which depends on this IP.

## Blocking questions

| # | Question | Options | Recommended default (pending confirmation) |
|---|----------|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| M1 | RTK support window (program question P6) | (A) 3 minor releases with deprecation notice. (B) Freeze and npm-deprecate immediately. (C) Support indefinitely. | **A**, N = 3 minors. Long enough for Flourish's own apps; short enough to be honest with new users. |
| M2 | Does `@terreno/rtk` get an `npm deprecate` marker? | (A) Yes, at the start of the window. (B) Only at end of window. (C) Never; docs only. | **B** — an `npm deprecate` warning during the support window creates install-time noise for consumers who are correctly still on RTK. Mark it at window close. |
| M3 | Is auth migration coupled to data-layer migration? | (A) Yes, one combined migration (JWT+RTK → Better Auth+syncdb). (B) Two independent migrations. (C) Auth first, then data. | **C** — Better Auth can be adopted while still on RTK, which lets consumers de-risk in two steps. Document that order explicitly. |
| M4 | What happens to `docs/reference/rtk.md`? | (A) Delete. (B) Keep, banner-marked Legacy, moved to `docs/reference/legacy/`. (C) Keep in place with a banner. | **B** — moving it makes the reference index tell the truth at a glance, and Docusaurus redirects keep old links alive. |
| M5 | Does SDK codegen change name/command? | (A) `bun run sdk` keeps working, new generator behind it. (B) New command `bun run sync:codegen`, old one deprecated. | **A** — same command, new generator. Consumers should not have to relearn the loop. Requires confirming `@terreno/syncdb-codegen`'s CLI shape from #869. |
| M6 | Do we ship a codemod? | (A) Yes, an automated `rtk→syncdb` codemod. (B) An `upgrading-terreno` skill that does it agent-assisted. (C) Manual guide only. | **B** — the mechanical part (hook renames) is small; the interesting part (optimistic mutations, conflict handling) needs judgment. Agent-assisted beats a brittle codemod. See [`upgrade-guides-and-skill`](upgrade-guides-and-skill.md). |
| M7 | Is offline/local-first presented as the default or an opt-in? | (A) Default — syncdb is local-first, period. (B) Opt-in mode with a server-first default. | **A** if #869 ships local-first as the only mode; otherwise (B). **Must be verified against the merged code, not assumed.** |

## Architecture

### Documentation surface map

Every document below currently describes an RTK-shaped world and must be reconciled.

| Document | Current state | Target state |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| `docs/reference/rtk.md` | Primary frontend reference | Moved to `docs/reference/legacy/rtk.md`, Legacy banner, links the migration guide |
| `docs/reference/syncdb.md` | does not exist | New primary frontend data reference |
| `docs/how-to/migrate-rtk-to-syncdb.md` | does not exist | New step-by-step migration guide |
| `docs/explanation/local-first-data.md` | does not exist | New conceptual explainer: why local-first, what changes for the developer |
| `docs/explanation/authentication.md` | JWT-primary | Better Auth primary, JWT documented as legacy |
| `docs/how-to/configure-better-auth.md` | Exists, positioned as optional | Repositioned as the default auth path |
| `docs/README.md` | Package table omits `ai`, `syncdb` | Complete package table with syncdb as the frontend data package |
| `.rulesync/skills/generate-sdk/SKILL.md` | RTK Query codegen | syncdb descriptor codegen; RTK path kept as a legacy branch during the support window |
| `.rulesync/rules/rtk/*` | RTK conventions for agents | New `syncdb` rules; RTK rules marked legacy |
| `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE-consumer.md` | "Always use generated SDK hooks" (RTK) | syncdb hooks; RTK guidance moved to a legacy note |
| `README.md` architecture diagram | `@terreno/rtk` box | `@terreno/syncdb` box |
| `mcp-server` resources + bootstrap templates | RTK store wiring | syncdb client wiring |

### The migration guide's shape

The migration guide is the highest-value artifact. It must be organized by *what the developer has to change*, not by package internals:

1. **Before you start** — decision table: adopt Better Auth first (M3), confirm backend version, confirm Mongo is a replica set.
2. **Install and configure** — add `@terreno/syncdb`, create the client, wrap the app, remove the Redux store or keep it side-by-side.
3. **Reads** — `useGetTodosQuery` → syncdb query hook. Show the same screen before and after, side by side.
4. **Writes** — `usePostTodosMutation` → syncdb mutation. This is where behavior genuinely changes: writes land locally first, so loading states, error handling, and optimistic-update code all get simpler or get deleted. Show what to delete.
5. **Conflicts** — new concept with no RTK equivalent. What a conflict is, when it happens, the two v1 strategies, and the minimum UI a consumer must add.
6. **Sync status** — replacing spinner-driven UX with sync-state UX.
7. **Auth** — JWT auth slice → Better Auth session, including token storage differences and the socket auth handshake.
8. **Codegen** — regenerating typed operations, and what changes in the generated file.
9. **Feature flags** — the OpenFeature provider's new data source.
10. **Rollback** — how to go back if it goes wrong, per-screen via the `USE_SYNCDB` flag.
11. **Checklist** — a copy-pasteable checklist for a real migration.

Each step needs a working before/after code pair taken from the actual `example-frontend` migration in #869, not invented.

### Deprecation signalling

| Channel | Action |
|---------|--------|
| `docs/reference/legacy/rtk.md` | Legacy banner with the support window and end date/version |
| `rtk/README.md` | Deprecation notice at the top linking the migration guide |
| Root `CHANGELOG.md` | `Deprecated` entry in the release that lands #869 |
| GitHub Discussions | Announcement post (see [`public-roadmap-github`](public-roadmap-github.md)) |
| `mcp-server/src/docs/upgrades/<version>.md` | Upgrade note so `terreno_get_upgrade_guide` returns it |
| `ROADMAP.md` | An item with `Impact = Breaking` and the removal target |
| Agent rules | `.rulesync/rules/rtk/` marked legacy so agents stop generating RTK code |

Agent rules matter most in practice: if the MCP server and bootstrap templates keep emitting RTK code, every AI-generated Terreno app starts on the deprecated path.

## Models

None.

## APIs

None new. This IP documents the surface #869 introduces; it must not add to it.

## Notifications

One Announcements discussion post at the start of the deprecation window. No in-app notifications.

## UI

None directly. The migration guide specifies the minimum conflict-resolution and sync-status UI a consumer must build; if `example-frontend` lacks a good reference implementation after #869, file a follow-up rather than inventing one here.

## Phases

1. **Reconcile with merged #869** — read the merged code, produce a verified inventory of the actual public API, and correct the surface map above. Nothing else starts until this is done.
2. **Reference docs** — `docs/reference/syncdb.md`, move and banner `rtk.md`, update `docs/README.md`.
3. **Migration guide** — the eleven-step guide with verified before/after pairs.
4. **Explainers and auth repositioning** — `local-first-data.md`, rewrite `authentication.md`, reposition Better Auth.
5. **Agent surfaces** — rules, skills, `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE*.md`, MCP resources and bootstrap templates.
6. **Deprecation signalling** — READMEs, changelog, upgrade note, announcement draft, roadmap item.

## Feature Flags & Migrations

- `USE_SYNCDB` (introduced by #869) is the consumer-side rollout flag; the migration guide is organized around enabling it per screen.
- No repo-side flag needed for documentation.
- Docusaurus redirects required for every moved page (`docs/reference/rtk.md` → `docs/reference/legacy/rtk.md`).

## Not Included / Future Work

- Removing `@terreno/rtk` from the monorepo (end of support window, separate IP).
- Native (iOS/Android) local storage encryption, which #869 explicitly defers.
- Migrating Flourish's internal apps.
- A `syncdb` performance/tuning guide.

## Task List

See [`docs/tasks/rtk-to-syncdb-migration-docs.md`](../tasks/rtk-to-syncdb-migration-docs.md).

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A verified inventory of `@terreno/syncdb`'s public exports exists and every documented API appears in the merged package's `src/index.ts`.
- [ ] `docs/reference/syncdb.md` documents every exported hook, client method, and config option, with a runnable example for each.
- [ ] `docs/how-to/migrate-rtk-to-syncdb.md` covers all eleven steps, and every before/after pair compiles against the merged code.
- [ ] Following the guide, a fresh clone of `example-frontend` can be moved from the RTK path to the syncdb path with no undocumented steps.
- [ ] `docs/reference/rtk.md` no longer exists at its old path; the Legacy page states the support window; a Docusaurus redirect resolves the old URL.
- [ ] `docs/explanation/authentication.md` presents Better Auth first and JWT as legacy.
- [ ] No agent-facing surface (`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE*.md`, `.rulesync/rules/`, MCP resources, bootstrap templates) instructs an agent to write RTK Query code for a new app.
- [ ] `terreno_bootstrap_app` output uses syncdb, and a bootstrapped app runs.
- [ ] `terreno_get_upgrade_guide` returns the syncdb upgrade note for the release range that includes #869.
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` has a `Deprecated` entry naming `@terreno/rtk`, the support window, and the migration guide link.
- [ ] `bun run lint`, `bun run compile`, `bun run rules:check`, and `bun run website:build` all pass.
