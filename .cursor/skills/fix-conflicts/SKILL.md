# Fix Conflicts

Pull the latest base, resolve merge conflicts, and validate the affected areas. Return
after the push; the outer lifecycle loop owns later CI observation.

## Instructions

1. Ensure the working tree is clean before starting:
   ```
   git status
   ```
   - If there are uncommitted changes, ask the user whether to stash them or abort

2. Resolve the PR/default base branch, then fetch and merge it into the current branch:
   ```
   BASE_BRANCH="$(gh pr view --json baseRefName --jq .baseRefName 2>/dev/null || git remote show origin | awk '/HEAD branch/ {print $NF}')"
   git fetch origin "$BASE_BRANCH"
   git merge "origin/$BASE_BRANCH"
   ```
   - If `BASE_BRANCH` is empty, stop and ask for the base; never guess `master`/`main`.
   - If the fetch or merge fails, check network connectivity and repository access permissions. Notify the user if the issue persists.

3. Check for merge conflicts:
   ```
   git diff --name-only --diff-filter=U
   ```
   - If there are no conflicts, skip to step 5

4. For each conflicted file:
    - Read the file and understand both sides of the conflict
    - Resolve the conflict by combining changes in a way that retains the functionality and purpose of both sets of changes, ensuring no critical information is lost.
    - If the conflict cannot be resolved automatically, notify the user and provide a summary of the conflicting changes.
    - After resolving all conflicts in a file, stage it:
       ```
       git add <file>
       ```
    - After all conflicts are resolved, complete the merge:
       ```
       git commit --no-edit
       ```

## Running Checks

5. Run lint and compile checks at the project root:
    ```
    git rev-parse --show-toplevel
    ```
    - Run linting:
       ```
       cd <project-root> && bun run lint
       ```
       - If linting fails, fix the issues and re-run until passing
    - Run type compilation/checking:
       ```
       cd <project-root> && bun run compile
       ```
       - If compilation fails, fix the type errors and re-run until passing
    - If linting or compilation fails repeatedly and cannot be resolved, notify the user with the error details and suggest seeking assistance.

## Handling Fixes and Commits

6. If any fixes were needed in step 5, stage and commit them:
   - Review the changes made
   - Create a commit with a clear message describing what was fixed
   - In step 6, do not use prefix commit format (feat:, fix:, chore:, etc.) for the commit message.
   - Do not mention AI, Claude, or any AI assistant

7. Push the changes:
   ```
   git push origin HEAD
   ```

8. Return the pushed head and validation evidence. Do not launch a watcher; Brew/Taste
   emits lifecycle state and the outer loop schedules later observation.
