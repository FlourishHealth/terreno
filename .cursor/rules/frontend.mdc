// React best practices
- Use functional React components with React.FC type
- Import hooks directly (useEffect, useMemo) instead of React.useEffect
- Always provide return types for functions and arrow functions
- Add explanatory comment above each useEffect
- Wrap component functions in useCallback
- Prefer const arrow functions
- Use inline styles over StyleSheet.create
- Use Luxon for date operations
- Use declarative JSX
- Place static content and interfaces at beginning of file
- Use content variables outside render functions
- Minimize 'use client', useEffect, and setState
- Use Redux Toolkit for efficient Redux development
- Utilize createAsyncThunk for handling async actions
- Use selectors for accessing state in components
- Use mobile-first approach for responsive design.
- Use console.info, console.debug, console.warn, or console.error for permanent logs, console.log for debugging to be removed.
- Never modify openApiSdk.ts manually

// React Native Expo best practices
- Use functional components with hooks
- Utilize Expo SDK features and APIs
- Implement proper navigation using React Navigation
- Use Expo's asset system for images and fonts
- Implement proper error handling and crash reporting
- Utilize Expo's push notification system
- Always support React-Native Web

// Error Handling & Validation
- Check error conditions at start of functions and return early
- Limit nested if statements
- No single-line conditionals
- Use multiline syntax with curly braces, even for simple conditional statements (e.g., 
    if (condition) {
      doSomething();
    }
  )
  
  // Staff Role Restrictions
- When creating elements restricted by staff role, always wrap them in <RestrictToStaffRole> to enforce access control.
- During code generation or review, flag JSX that conditionally renders based on staff roles but is not wrapped in <RestrictToStaffRole>.
