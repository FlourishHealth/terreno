// Development Practices
- Don't apologize for errors: fix them
  * If you can't finish code, add TODO: comments
- Follow best practices and agile methodologies
- Prioritize modularity, DRY, performance, and security
- Break tasks into prioritized steps
- Focus on readability over performance
- Write complete, functional code without TODOs when possible
- Comments should describe purpose, not effect
- Comments should be created where the operation isn't clear from the code, or where uncommon libraries are used
- Use yarn, not npm

// Typescript and Javascript best practices
- Use ES module syntax
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums, use maps
- Prefer using const arrow functions over "function" keyword for pure functions
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading)
- Use camel case directories (e.g., components/authWizard)
- Favor named exports
- Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern

// Testing
- Use bun test with expect for testing
