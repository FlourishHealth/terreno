    "A component that detects user inactivity by monitoring touch events and keyboard interactions. When the user hasn't interacted with the app for a specified duration, it triggers a callback. This is useful for implementing session timeouts, auto-logout features, or any functionality that depends on user activity state. No demo is available as this component requires app-level integration.",
