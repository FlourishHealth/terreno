### @terreno/syncdb

Use SyncDB for collection CRUD. Reads come from the local TinyBase store; writes
use `useMutate` or `client.mutate` and enter the durable outbox.

When debugging a running app, use the local Terreno MCP before arbitrary runtime
evaluation:

1. Create the client with `debug: true` in development.
2. Call `get_syncdb_state` for entities, tombstones, pending mutations, outbox,
   conflicts, cursors, streams, repair markers, status, and debug events.
3. Use `syncdb_snapshot` before and after reproduction, then compare the captures.
4. Set `TERRENO_MCP_EVAL=1` only when state changes are required; use
   `syncdb_action` for mutations, local-only edits, outbox flush, reconcile,
   resync, conflict resolution, retries, offline simulation, and snapshot merge.

Sensitive fields are redacted from MCP responses. Direct local edits and snapshot
merges bypass normal mutation/outbox semantics; use them only to reproduce or
repair local-state problems.

Full workflow: `docs/how-to/debug-with-mcp.md`. API details:
`docs/reference/syncdb.md` and `docs/reference/mcp-server.md`.
