 * Web persister storing the whole MergeableStore as ONE encrypted binary blob
 * in IndexedDB (database per `databaseName`, single object store, single
 * record). The plaintext JSON only ever exists in memory: serialize → encode
 * (AES-GCM) → put blob. Corrupt or undecryptable data is treated as a fresh
 * store — `onDecryptFailure` fires so the caller can wipe and re-bootstrap.
 *
 * A READ error from IndexedDB itself (as opposed to "no record yet") is a
 * different failure mode (E3a): the blob may well still be intact, so it must
 * NOT be treated as "fresh store" (which would let a subsequent autosave
 * clobber it with empty content). `onLoadFailure` fires in that case instead
 * of `onDecryptFailure`, and the underlying read error is re-thrown so
 * TinyBase's own `getPersisted` error handling leaves the in-memory store
 * exactly as it was (never calls `setContentOrChanges`) — callers key off
 * `onLoadFailure` to additionally skip `startAutoSave()` for this session.
 *
 * Saves are debounced with a trailing edge (default 500ms) since TinyBase's
 * autosave fires on every transaction: each write waits out the debounce
 * window, and follow-up saves whose serialized content matches the last
 * written snapshot are skipped, coalescing a burst of transactions into a
 * single encode + IndexedDB put.
