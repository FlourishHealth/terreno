 * `Persists.MergeableStoreOnly` or `Persists.StoreOrMergeableStore`) so CRDT
 * metadata survives the round trip.
 *
 * `hooks` carries the client's E3 failure-surfacing callbacks
 * (`onDecryptFailure`/`onLoadFailure`/`onSaveFailure`) — always passed
 * through regardless of whether the default or a custom factory is in use, so
 * a host app supplying its own `persisterFactory` (e.g. a different storage
 * backend) can still opt into the same SyncStatus surfacing by wiring these
 * into its own persister. Optional to consume; a factory that ignores
 * `hooks` simply forgoes that surfacing (matches pre-E3 behavior).
