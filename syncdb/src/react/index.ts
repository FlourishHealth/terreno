 * React bindings for @terreno/syncdb.

 * Published as the `@terreno/syncdb/react` subpath (see package.json
 * "exports") and deliberately NOT re-exported from the package's main index:
 * `react` is an optional peer dependency, and keeping these modules off the
 * main entry means non-React (node/backend) consumers never load React.
