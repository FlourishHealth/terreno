# Verify UI Changes

Use this skill automatically whenever a task changes UI behavior, UI layout, visual styling, component stories, navigation screens, user-visible copy, or any full-stack feature with a frontend surface.

## Trigger Files

Load this skill before validating changes to:

- `*.tsx`
- `*.jsx`
- `*.html`
- `*.css`
- `*.scss`
- `*.less`
- `*.styl`
- `*.vue`
- Story/demo files that render UI states
- Theme, layout, navigation, or component configuration that changes rendered UI
- Full-stack PRs that include any of the above, even when backend files dominate the diff

## Mandatory Workflow (every frontend-touching feature)

Do not open or update a PR for frontend work until this workflow is complete.

1. **Launch the correct app** for the package that changed (see package-specific sections below).
2. **Log in** when the app requires authentication — use the seeded test accounts documented below.
3. **Attempt to use the changed feature** — navigate to the affected screen and exercise the primary user flow end to end, not just confirm the app or page loads.
4. **Save evidence** under `/opt/cursor/artifacts/`:
   - Screenshots for static visual states → e.g. `/opt/cursor/artifacts/screenshots/<feature>-<state>.png`
   - Screen recordings for interaction flows → e.g. `/opt/cursor/artifacts/<feature>-demo.mp4`
   - Use `RecordScreen` in Cursor Cloud for video walkthroughs.
5. **Post evidence to the PR** before finishing:
   - Match [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../../../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md):
     add one concise `Verification` table row for the exercised flow.
   - Reference artifacts with HTML tags and absolute paths, e.g. `<img alt="Todos list after filter" src="/opt/cursor/artifacts/screenshots/todos-filter.png" />` or `<video src="/opt/cursor/artifacts/todos-create.mp4" controls></video>`.
   - Use the PR management tool to create or update the PR body after artifacts exist.
   - Name the flow and UI state proved. Never include credentials.

If environment setup blocks verification, add one `⚠️ Not tested` row naming the
blocked behavior and exact reviewer action. Put only decisive error detail in an optional
`<details>` block. Do not present compile-only or app-start-only checks as complete
verification.

## Verification Requirements

1. Define the visible success state.
   - State what a skeptical reviewer should see on screen.
   - Include loading, empty, disabled, error, and responsive states when the change affects them.

2. Run targeted automated checks when available.
   - Prefer package-specific lint, compile, and component tests.
   - If the change only affects generated docs or static skill/rule text, use rulesync/static checks instead.

3. Perform mandatory manual UI verification.
   - Start the exact app listed below for the package that changed.
   - Use the browser or simulator to navigate to the changed UI.
   - Log in with seeded credentials when the app requires auth.
   - Exercise the changed interaction and the path that reaches it.
   - Capture a screenshot for static visual changes.
   - Capture a short video for interaction flows.

4. Critically review the evidence.
   - Check spacing, alignment, truncation, disabled/loading states, and error states.
   - Confirm the changed code path actually ran.
   - If the evidence is inconclusive, adjust the test and verify again.

5. Document limitations honestly.
   - If manual UI testing is blocked by environment setup, explain the exact blocker and list the commands or setup steps attempted.
   - Do not present compile-only or app-start-only checks as complete UI verification.

## Package-Specific Manual Verification

### `@terreno/ui` component changes

Test UI package component changes only in the demo app.

1. Start the demo web app from the repo root:

   ```bash
   bun run demo:start
   ```

   Or from `demo/`:

   ```bash
   bun run web
   ```

   The demo runs on `http://localhost:8085`.

2. Open the developer-mode screen for the changed component:

   ```text
   http://localhost:8085/dev
   ```

3. Select the component and the most relevant story.
   - Direct URLs use the component name from `demo/demoConfig.tsx` and a story query param.
   - **The `?story=` value must exactly match a key of the `stories` object in
     `demo/story-config/<Component>.config.tsx`, URL-encoded.** These keys are human-readable
     display names, not slugs — e.g. `http://localhost:8085/dev/Button?story=Variants`, and they can
     contain spaces, which must be URL-encoded (`?story=Inline%20Feedback%20Prompt`).
     `demo/app/dev/[component].tsx` calls `router.replace("/dev")` only when `story` is absent or the
     component isn't in `demoConfig.tsx`; a *valid component with an unknown story* renders a **blank
     page** instead. Either way you get no error, so confirm the story actually rendered.
   - Use `/dev/<Component>?story=<Story>` to see one raw story full-screen.
   - Use `/demo/<Component>` when you need the **interactive prop controls**
     (`demoOptions.controls` — selects, booleans). Those controls render *only* on the `/demo`
     page, not on `/dev`. The `/demo` page also renders every story at the bottom, so it is the
     fastest way to see all states plus drive props from one screen.

4. Verify the changed state and at least one adjacent state that could regress.
   - For visual primitives: compare default, disabled, loading, icon, and full-width states when relevant.
   - For interactive components: click, type, open, close, hover, and keyboard navigate as appropriate.

5. When shipping a **new** `@terreno/ui` component or changing public props, also verify the generated docs page:
   - Run `cd ui && bun run types && bun run website:generate`
   - Check the docs deploy preview (or `bun run website:build` locally) for the component page and embedded demo iframe.

Do not launch the example app to validate isolated `@terreno/ui` component changes unless the change also affects an app-level integration.

#### Driving the `/demo` prop controls

The controls are `@terreno/ui` `Field`s, **not native HTML inputs**:

- A `type: "select"` control renders a custom dropdown — there is **no `<select>` element**, so
  Playwright/CDP `selectOption`-style helpers do nothing. Click the field to open the option list,
  then click the option row. After opening, the field's `<input>` swaps its value for a
  `placeholder="Search..."`, which is a reliable signal that the list is open.
- A `type: "boolean"` control renders a toggle `<div>`; click it directly.

#### Objectively verifying icon fill, color, and icon family

Screenshots alone make solid-vs-outline and two similar greys hard to judge. Read computed styles
instead — both the Terreno `Icon` and `@expo/vector-icons` render **font glyphs**, so:

- **Which icon set is actually rendering** → computed `font-family` on the glyph element. This is
  the definitive check when a component migrates icon libraries: Terreno's `Icon` falls back to
  FontAwesome6 (`FontAwesome6Free-Solid` / `FontAwesome6Free-Regular`), whereas a direct
  `import Feather from "@expo/vector-icons/Feather"` reports `feather` and
  `import MaterialIcons from "@expo/vector-icons/MaterialIcons"` reports `material` (from
  `createIconSet(glyphMap, 'Material Icons', ...)` — the computed value is normalised, so don't
  expect the literal string `MaterialIcons`). Don't try to judge this from a screenshot — the
  glyphs look similar at small sizes. This whole procedure only applies to **font-backed** icons: a
  custom icon registered through `TerrenoProvider`'s icon registry takes precedence over the
  FontAwesome glyph set (`ui/src/Icon.tsx`) and may render SVG or any component, so probe its own
  markup rather than `font-family`.
- **Fill / `type` prop** (FontAwesome `Icon` only) → computed `font-family`:
  `FontAwesome6Free-Solid` for `type="solid"` vs `FontAwesome6Free-Regular` for `type="regular"`.
  Note that most `@expo/vector-icons` sets (Feather included) have **no solid variant**, so a
  component using them must signal selection some other way — usually a filled surface behind
  the glyph. When that is the design, verify the `backgroundColor` and `borderRadius` of the
  wrapping `Pressable` rather than the glyph's fill (see "Verifying a filled-surface selection
  cue" below).
- **Fill via a different icon *name*** (the strongest check, and the one to reach for with sets
  that ship paired outline/filled glyphs such as MaterialIcons' `thumb-up-off-alt` vs
  `thumb-up-alt`) → read the glyph element's **`textContent` codepoint**. `@expo/vector-icons`
  renders the icon as a single character from the icon font, so `el.textContent.codePointAt(0)`
  identifies exactly which icon name is rendering. Resolve the expected numbers from the shipped
  glyphmap so you are asserting against ground truth rather than a guess:

  ```bash
  # glyphmaps live under node_modules/**/@expo/vector-icons/build/vendor/.../glyphmaps/<Set>.json
  node -e 'const m=require("<path>/MaterialIcons.json");
    for (const n of ["thumb-up-off-alt","thumb-up-alt"]) console.log(n, m[n], "U+"+m[n].toString(16));'
  ```

  This matters because a broken name mapping still recolours correctly, so a colour-only check
  passes on a component whose fill never changes. Colour is not proof of fill; the codepoint is.
- **The icon font actually loaded** → a failed font load renders tofu boxes while the codepoint
  check still passes, so also assert `document.fonts.check('20px <family>')` and confirm the family
  appears with status `loaded` in `document.fonts`. To rule out fallback rendering, measure the
  glyph's advance width in the icon family versus a generic fallback family and check that they
  *differ* — icon glyphs are not guaranteed to be square, so treat a specific width (e.g. exactly
  20px) as a smell rather than a pass/fail rule, and prefer font-loading or network evidence. After a
  migration, assert the **probed glyph's** computed family is the new one; do not require the old
  family to be absent from `document.fonts`, since another element or an earlier mount in this SPA
  session can keep it registered.
- **Size** → computed `font-size` in px. `iconSizeToNumber` in `ui/src/Common.ts` maps
  `xs/sm/md/lg/xl/2xl` → `8/12/16/20/24/28`.
- **Color** → computed `color`, compared against `theme.text[...]` in `ui/src/Theme.tsx`.
  Watch out: the `text` color map and the surface/other maps use the **same token names for
  different primitives**. In the light theme `text.secondaryDark` is `secondary800` (`#092E3A`),
  **not** `secondary500` — always trace the map that the component actually reads
  (`Icon` uses `theme.text[color]`).

Read these from the icon element (the `Pressable`'s first element child), e.g. a one-shot probe
returning `{fontFamily, fontSize, color, disabled}` per button, and snapshot it before *and* after
each interaction. For a disabled no-op, assert the after-state is identical to the before-state,
then re-enable and repeat the same click to prove the hit target was live all along.

Measure geometry with the page at its default scale. Browser page zoom does *not* skew these
comparisons — `getBoundingClientRect()` and computed `font-size` are both CSS pixels — but a CDP
`Emulation.setPageScaleFactor`/`setDeviceMetricsOverride` scale factor or a pinch-zoomed
`visualViewport.scale` does change the mapping to device pixels. Record `window.devicePixelRatio`
and `visualViewport.scale` alongside the numbers you report so a mismatch is attributable.

#### Verifying a filled-surface selection cue (and its contrast)

When selection is shown by a background circle/pill instead of a glyph change, probe the
**`Pressable`** (not the glyph) for `backgroundColor` and `borderRadius`, and assert:

- selected → a concrete `rgb(...)` matching the intended `theme.surface[...]` token;
- unselected → `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)` (transparent);
- `borderRadius` is exactly half the tap target at every size, otherwise it is a rounded square
  rather than a circle.

Also **compute contrast ratios from the rendered colors**, since a surface-only cue can be too
subtle where a solid-vs-outline cue never was. Walk up the DOM to find the first ancestor with a
non-transparent `backgroundColor` to get the real page background (the demo page surface is
`#F2F2F2`, not white), then apply the WCAG relative-luminance formula. Check both
glyph-on-surface (aim ≥4.5:1) and **surface-vs-page-background**, which WCAG 1.4.11 wants at ≥3:1
for a non-text state indicator — pale tokens like `secondary100` (`#B6CDD5`) land around 1.48:1 on
`#F2F2F2` and are worth flagging to design as a non-blocking observation. Muted-icon-on-`surface.disabled`
combinations tend to be ~2:1 grey-on-grey; that is cosmetic (disabled controls are exempt from
WCAG contrast) but still worth a screenshot and a note.

#### Verifying pixel geometry against a Figma spec

When a PR claims a component now matches a Figma frame, verify the numbers at **browser zoom 1**
and report what you actually measured rather than rounding to "matches":

- Glyph box → `getBoundingClientRect()` on the icon element; also cross-check computed `font-size`.
- Distance between two icons → measure **both** the tap-target centers and the glyph centers. If
  they disagree, the glyph is not centered in its pressable.
- Don't take a `gap` prop on trust: measure `next.left - prev.right` in the DOM. Terreno's spacing
  scale means `gap={2}` is 8px, so `24px target + 8px gap = 32px` between centers — verify that
  arithmetic instead of assuming it.
- Figma often specifies the gap between *icon boxes* while the DOM gap is between *tap targets*.
  With a 16px glyph in a 24px target these differ by 8px (16 vs 8) — both can be "correct" at once,
  so state which one you measured.

#### Painted ink vs the em box

`getBoundingClientRect()` on a glyph element returns the **em box** (equal to `font-size`), which is
not what a designer means by "the icon is 16px" — icon fonts pad their artwork inside the em box, so
a 20px MaterialIcons thumb paints about 16.5 x 14.9 px. When the spec is about the *visible* icon,
measure the ink:

1. **Screenshot pixel analysis (preferred).** Set `document.body.style.zoom = 8`, screenshot, compute
   the bounding box of non-background pixels, and divide by the zoom factor — validating that factor
   independently first (a known 32px centre distance should measure 256px).
2. **Canvas `TextMetrics`** — `measureText(glyph)` with `actualBoundingBoxLeft/Right/Ascent/Descent`
   in the normalized family at the same px size. Faster, but it rounds outward from the rasterized
   ink and can read 1-2px large. Use a **synchronous** IIFE; an async one returns an unserialized
   Promise (`{}`).

Report width and height separately. Icon glyphs are rarely square, so "make the ink exactly NxN" is
usually impossible with one font-size — give the font-size that satisfies each dimension and let the
author pick which one the Figma box is keyed to.

#### Flush (zero-gap) tap targets

When adjacent targets have no gap, assert `positive.right === negative.left` and a non-overlap check
rather than only the centre distance, and hit-test a few px either side of the shared edge with
`document.elementFromPoint` to prove neither target steals the other's clicks.

#### Prop tables come from generated TypeDoc, not the source

The demo Props table is rendered from `demo/ui-types-documentation.json` (mirrored into
`mcp-server/{src,dist}/docs/`). Those files are **git-ignored build output**, so a PR that removes or
renames a public prop in `ui/src/Common.ts` will still show the dead prop in a demo app started from
a stale copy. Regenerate with `bun run generate-types` in `demo/` before reading the Props table, and
report drift as a local staleness issue, not a missing commit.

Note `demoOptions.size` in `demo/story-config/*.config.tsx` is the demo *panel* sizing key used by
many configs — unrelated to a component's own `size` prop, and not stale metadata.

#### Traps when clicking small tap targets

Two things will silently produce bogus click results:

1. **Screenshot coordinates are not CSS coordinates.** The browser screenshot may be 1024px wide
   while `window.innerWidth` is 1600 (scale 0.64). If your click tool takes *screenshot-image*
   coordinates, multiply CSS coordinates by `screenshotWidth / innerWidth` first; Playwright/CDP
   `mouse.click` takes **viewport CSS pixels**, so pass `getBoundingClientRect()` values straight
   through and do NOT rescale. Know which space your tool uses — guessing wrong makes clicks land on
   nothing and look like a dead hit target.
2. **A fully-rounded pressable has a circular hit area.** With `borderRadius: tapTarget / 2` the
   bounding-box corners are not clickable — sweeping `document.elementFromPoint` over the box shows
   only ~84% of it hits the button. Always click the **center**, and if you need to characterise the
   real target, do the `elementFromPoint` pixel sweep rather than guessing.

Also probe the midpoint of the gap between two adjacent targets with `elementFromPoint`: if it
returns neither button, the hit areas don't touch and cannot steal each other's clicks. Compare the
tap-target size against WCAG 2.5.8 (24×24 CSS px); anything smaller may still pass via the spacing
exception if a 24px circle on each target wouldn't intersect the neighbour's, so report the number
rather than declaring a violation.

#### `accessibilityState.selected` does not reach the web DOM

react-native-web maps the `disabled` half of `accessibilityState` (you get `disabled` +
`tabindex="-1"`) but for `accessibilityRole="button"` it drops `selected` — no `aria-selected`,
`aria-pressed` or `aria-checked` is emitted. So a `Pressable` with
`accessibilityState={{selected: isSelected}}` renders a selected DOM node **identical** to an
unselected one apart from its content. Always verify this by dumping every attribute of both nodes
rather than trusting the source.

This matters most when a design unifies selected/unselected colors so glyph shape is the only visual
cue: there is then no non-visual cue at all, and docs claiming "selection is announced via
accessibility state" are false on web. The fix must be a **role-compatible** state: `aria-selected`
is only valid on selectable composite descendants (tab, option, row, gridcell), so it is wrong on a
button. Use `accessibilityRole="checkbox"` + `aria-checked` for a two-state control (see the
keyboard caveat below), or `aria-pressed` if a toggle-button role is available.

Confirmed root cause: `react-native-web` (checked at 0.21.2) only consumes **flat** props in
`dist/modules/createDOMProps/index.js` (`aria-checked`, `aria-selected`, `aria-disabled`, …) and
never reads `accessibilityState` at all. The `disabled` half only appears to work because
`Pressable`'s own `disabled` prop sets it through a separate path. Note RN 0.81 has no
`aria-pressed` prop and RNW has no mapping for `accessibilityRole="togglebutton"`, so
`accessibilityRole="checkbox"` + `aria-checked` is usually the only two-state option that is both
typed by RN and forwarded by RNW.

#### Changing `accessibilityRole` changes the rendered ELEMENT — always re-test the keyboard

This is the trap that a role fix is most likely to introduce, and no amount of attribute dumping
will catch it. RNW renders `accessibilityRole="button"` as a **real `<button type="button">`**
(verify on any Terreno `Button`: `/dev/Button?story=Variants` shows
`<button aria-label="…" type="button">`), so both **Space** and **Enter** activate it via browser
default with no JS. Any other role — `checkbox`, `switch`, `radio`, `tab` — renders a plain
`<div role="…" tabindex="0">`, where there is no browser default activation and RNW's Pressable
keyboard path wires **Enter only**. Switching `button` → `checkbox` therefore silently drops Space,
which for `role="checkbox"` is the canonical ARIA APG activation key (Enter isn't even required).

So after any `accessibilityRole` change, test with the real keyboard, not just clicks:

1. `Tab` to the control and confirm a visible focus ring.
2. Press **Space**; dump `aria-checked`/`aria-pressed` and the visible state.
3. Press **Enter**; dump again.
4. Report which keys actually toggle. If Space is dead on a `checkbox`/`switch`/`radio` role, that is
   a real keyboard-accessibility defect — suggest an explicit `onKeyDown` handling `" "` / `"Space"`
   with `preventDefault()` (to suppress page scroll), or backing the control with a real
   `<input type="checkbox">`.

When a component does add its own `onKeyDown`, check two things a native button gives you for free:
that Space does not scroll (test on a page with **real** scroll room and assert `scrollY`/`scrollTop`
is unchanged), and that a **held** key does not rapid-fire — `keydown` repeats while the key is down,
so the handler needs `if (event.repeat) return;`. A discrete-key-press harness cannot observe
auto-repeat, so read the source for the `event.repeat` guard rather than claiming it verified.

To decide whether it is a *regression* rather than pre-existing, read the previous commit's source
(`git show <prev>:path/to/Component.tsx | grep accessibility`) — if it used `accessibilityRole="button"`
it was a native button and Space used to work.

#### Baselining console warnings

The demo app emits pre-existing React-Native-Web deprecations on essentially every page
(`props.pointerEvents is deprecated`). Before blaming your component, load an unrelated component
page (e.g. `/demo/IconButton`) and diff the console output. Only warnings that appear on your page
and not the baseline are attributable to your change.

The `"shadow*" style props are deprecated. Use "boxShadow".` warning is fixed — `@terreno/ui` uses
`boxShadow` (see `createBoxShadow` in `ui/src/Utilities.tsx`) and `react-native-modalize` /
`react-native-actions-sheet` are patched in `patches/`. If it reappears, a new `shadow*` style prop
was introduced; do not re-add it to the baseline.

### `admin-frontend` and example app UI changes

Test `admin-frontend` changes in the example full-stack app.

1. Start the backend from the repo root:

   ```bash
   bun run backend:dev
   ```

   The backend runs on `http://localhost:4000`.

2. Seed login data in a separate terminal:

   ```bash
   cd example-backend && bun run seed
   ```

3. Start the frontend from the repo root:

   ```bash
   bun run frontend:web
   ```

   The frontend runs on `http://localhost:8082`.

4. Log in with the seeded admin account:
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `testpassword123`

5. Navigate to the changed admin screen.
   - Admin home: `http://localhost:8082/admin`
   - Model table: `http://localhost:8082/admin/<modelName>`
   - Configuration: `http://localhost:8082/admin/configuration`
   - Consent forms: `http://localhost:8082/admin/consent-forms`
   - Consent responses: `http://localhost:8082/admin/consent-responses`

6. Verify both the changed screen and the path that gets the user there.
   - For list/table changes: verify loading, populated, empty, pagination, sorting, and row navigation when applicable.
   - For form changes: verify create/edit validation, save loading, cancel/back navigation, and error handling.
   - For admin cards/navigation: verify the card appears, the label/copy is correct, and click navigation still works.

### Other frontend package changes

- `example-frontend` user-facing screens: use `bun run backend:dev`, `cd example-backend && bun run seed`, and `bun run frontend:web`, then log in with `test@example.com` / `testpassword123`, navigate to the changed feature, and exercise it.
- Demo-only story changes: use the demo app `/dev` route and the story being changed.
- Generated SDK or API-surface-only frontend changes: combine targeted automated checks with an example app login + feature smoke test when a rendered UI path is affected.

## GitHub Reviewer Evidence

Post UI verification evidence to GitHub through the PR body so reviewers can see it without local setup.

- Follow [`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](../../../../.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).
- Save screenshots and videos under `/opt/cursor/artifacts`.
- Reference only decisive artifacts in the `Verification` table with HTML tags, e.g.
  `<video src="/opt/cursor/artifacts/admin_model_list_demo.mp4" controls></video>`.
- Name the tested URL, changed flow/state, and what the artifact proves. Never include
  credentials.
- Use the PR management tool to create or update the PR body after artifacts are available.
- Keep evidence minimal: one short video is preferred for interaction flows, plus one screenshot when it shows a static visual state more clearly.

## Cursor Cloud Notes

- Delegate GUI-driven verification to the `ui-verifier` subagent when your harness supports subagents; in Cursor Cloud, fall back to its built-in browser/GUI capability.
- Use `RecordScreen` for user-facing video walkthroughs of interactive UI changes.
- Leave test servers running after verification so the user can continue testing.

## Final Response Checklist

- Include the relevant screenshot or video artifact for UI changes.
- Prefix every command in the testing section with pass, warning, or fail status.
- Explain why each test or check was run.
- Mention any environment limitation only when it prevented expected UI verification.
- Confirm PR evidence was posted or will be posted before the PR is opened/updated.

## Pixel Measurement: Derive the Screenshot Scale Empirically

When measuring painted ink (or any exact pixel geometry) from a zoomed screenshot, never assume
`saved screenshot px == zoom factor × CSS px`. The screenshot the harness writes to disk can be a
different size than the image it shows inline, and the browser window may have been resized between
runs.

Do this before dividing by the zoom factor:

1. Read `window.innerWidth` and compare it to the width of the saved PNG. If they are equal, one
   screenshot pixel is one CSS layout pixel and the zoom factor is the only divisor.
2. Cross-validate against a known layout pitch (e.g. two flush 32px targets must sit exactly
   `32 × zoom` screenshot px apart). If the pitch does not match, the scale assumption is wrong and
   every derived number is wrong.
3. Measure each glyph inside **its own element rect** (from `getBoundingClientRect()` at the same
   zoom), not across the whole image — otherwise adjacent labels and section bands leak into the
   bounding box.
4. Use the **modal colour of that sub-region** as the background reference rather than a hardcoded
   page background, and re-run the bbox at 2–3 thresholds (e.g. background delta > 10 / 30 / 60).
   A measurement that shifts with the threshold is an antialiasing artefact, not a result.
5. Report ink width and height separately per variant, plus the non-background pixel count — the
   count is what distinguishes a filled glyph from an outline glyph that shares the same bbox.
