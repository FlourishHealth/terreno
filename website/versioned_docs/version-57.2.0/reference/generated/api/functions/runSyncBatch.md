> **runSyncBatch**(`__namedParameters`): `Promise`\<[`SyncBatchRunResult`](../interfaces/SyncBatchRunResult.md)\>

Shared orchestration for a BATCH: validate (size cap + intra-batch duplicate ids),
then rate limit, then apply.

Validation runs FIRST so a malformed batch consumes no budget — it was never going to
be applied, and charging for it let a buggy client rate-limit itself out of the
mutations that would have succeeded. The budget is then charged per MUTATION (not per
batch), so batching cannot buy extra throughput over single sends.
