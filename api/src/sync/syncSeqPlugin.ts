/**
 * Schema plugin for sync-enabled models. Stamps a monotonic per-stream `_syncSeq` on
 * every single-document write and records `_syncPrevStream` when a write moves the
 * document between scopes (owner/tenant change).
 *
 * Apply to the schema alongside `isDeletedPlugin`; activation is keyed off the sync
 * registry, so models that are not registered via modelRouter's `sync` option no-op.
 *
 * Sequencing guarantees (C1 — stable frontier):
 * - Validation failures never consume a seq: Mongoose runs validation before user
 *   pre('save') hooks, so the claim happens post-validation.
 * - Each claim registers the claimed seq on the counter's in-flight `pending` registry;
 *   the matching post-write hook (`confirmSyncSeqs`) clears it. Until confirmed, the
 *   stream's stable frontier holds below the claimed seq, so a snapshot/delta cursor
 *   never advances past a seq whose owning write has not yet committed. A crash between
 *   claim and confirm leaves a stale pending entry that ages out via the lease.
 * - The claim joins the caller's session when one is present; that path gets true
 *   counter+write atomicity and skips the pending registry entirely (no confirm due).
 * - Every write path claims in its pre hook and confirms in its POST hook — single saves,
 *   `insertMany` batches, and query-writes alike. Confirming before the documents commit
 *   would let a cursor advance past seqs that have not landed, permanently stranding those
 *   documents below every catch-up cursor.
 *
 * Scope moves (C4): when a write moves the document between streams, a durable
 * `SyncScopeMove` marker is written AFTER the move commits, carrying a seq claimed from
 * the OLD stream's counter. The change-stream watcher and old-stream snapshot catch-up
 * tombstone the document from the marker (not the racy `_syncPrevStream` post-image),
 * so a racing second write can no longer erase the tombstone. `_syncPrevStream` is still
 * stamped (harmless), but the marker is the source of truth. Writing the marker
 * post-commit keeps a failed write from leaving a phantom tombstone; the insert is
 * retried ({@link SCOPE_MOVE_MARKER_ATTEMPTS}) because a committed move whose marker is
 * lost can never be tombstoned on the old stream.
 *
 * Lost-update protection (Task 9.13): the plugin turns on Mongoose
 * `optimisticConcurrency`, so `doc.save()` on an existing document filters by the loaded
 * `__v` and throws a `VersionError` when another write landed in between. This closes the
 * read-compare-save TOCTOU window in `executeUpdate`'s `baseVersion` check — two clients
 * sending the same `baseVersion` concurrently now produce exactly one ack and one conflict
 * instead of two acks with one edit silently lost. The loser's already-claimed seq is
 * released (never stamped on anything), so the stream's frontier does not stall for the
 * pending-claim lease.
 *
 * Write restrictions:
 * - `updateMany`, `deleteMany`, hard deletes, and `bulkWrite` are unsupported on synced
 *   models and all throw. The first three are guarded here; `bulkWrite` bypasses
 *   middleware entirely, so `registerSync` replaces that static on the model instead.
 * - Query-writes MUST target a single document by `_id` (m9): a non-`_id` filter could
 *   match a different document than intended and stamp the wrong stream's seq.
 * - `upsert: true` is rejected on query-writes (m8/C6): an upsert can create a document
 *   the pre-write lookup never saw, escaping seq stamping.
